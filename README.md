### Poem

"Not All Who Wander Are Lost"

Wandering traveler, who walked so far

From day into night, still humming your song

But tired and weary, you look at the stars

They watch from above, wonder where you belong?


But they don't know, your personal legend

To find the place you once called as home

Never stayed place, not even a second

Now that you're older, No more will you roam



Hold tight to your spirit,let no one take it

With hope and strong will to carry on

Don't let them blind you, not even a bit

Keep your head and voice high,from dusk to dawn


No matter the time, no matter the cost

They will soon realize, you are not lost
